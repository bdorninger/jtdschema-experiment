# Json Validation

Contains code to play around with JSON schemata. (using AJV: https://ajv.js.org/)

Trying two variants:

* JSON Schema Draft 7
* JSON Type definitions

See [Comparison: Json Schema or TypeDefinition](https://ajv.js.org/guide/schema-language.html#comparison) for an overview when to choose what.

One important thing though: There is no support for JTD for C++ yet.....
